# Spring Boot Security JWT Access and Refresh Tokens

## Introduction

- This project encompasses two security concepts, Authentication and Authorization.
    - Authentication is verifying who the user is, do we know them? Do they exist in the database? Are their credentials correct? If they are known to you then allow them into the application and give them a token which they will use to access resources (API endpoints) in the application.
    - Authorization is giving and not giving access to users to certain resources on the application based on the specific roles assigned to them. They are already logged in but are they authorized to access certain priviledges? Are they an admin? Are they a super admin? Are they a normal user? Based on they are, you give and limit access to certain resources.
